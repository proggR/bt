    <h1>Brandon Thorn</h1>
    <h2>aka <em>proggR</em>/<em>sgtgroucho</em></h2>
    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a fullstack/blockchain/game dev who likes to play with new toys and experiment with zany ideas. Some interests include economics/finance, history, sociology/psychology, and communities. When put together, "socialcapitalism" has remained a core interest driving a lot of R&D projects.
    </p>
    <h3>What Drives Me?</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy reducing complexity through analysis and lateral problem solving, but subsist off the act of meaningful and challenging creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find our very existence and social development fascinating and from that fascination I seek to learn as much as I can about the world and ourselves every day. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The increase in information bandwidth and opportunity potential caused by the simple act of putting people together, along with the theory of multiple discoveries, make me dream of a new world where progress is deterministically driven forward through the power of a heroic community, rather than heroic individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I strive to both see and create opportunities that allow me to reduce information asymmetry, and in doing so make the world a more fair and equitable place.
    </p>

    <ul>      
      <li><strong><a href="https://deit.ca" target="_blank">DEIT</a></strong> (2020) &mdash; R&D brand for decentralized experimentation and development. Pivoting toward adding fund management/trading uses of the brand as initially intended.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://wethecommonwealth.org" target="_blank">Commonwealth</a></strong> (2023) &mdash; A model for a new DAO managed Fiat currency, which includes W3C DID compliant Identity and a DAO-of-DAOs oriented governance service layer.<br/><strong>The thesis is:</strong> Monetary Base + ID + Federated Bottom-Up Governance = The foundation for a socialcapitalism featuring <a href="https://github.com/DEITrust/SI2" target="_blank">Social Insurance 2.0</a>.</li>      
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/DEITrust/shinyblocks" target="_blank">Shinyblocks</a></strong> (2023) &mdash; Inspired by Diamonds, Shinyblocks intends to encapsulate the ERC2535 spec in JS, while stretch goaling to supporting Hardhat deployments. WIP but still useful for simple smart contract interactions (used in most recent diamond-hardhat branch).</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://proggr.hashnode.dev" target="_blank">Diamond Driven Development</a></strong> (2022) &mdash; A blog started as a means to capture the workflow/simplicity of ERC2535, has since become more general acting as the DEIT blog. Intend to spin "Diamond Driven Development" into its own brand.</li>
      <li><strong>Unnamed TCG Project</strong> (2023) &mdash; Inspired in part by the power of AI tools, I've started scratching the surface on a lifelong dream: making a TCG.</li>      
      <li><strong><a href="https://quintemusic.ca" target="_blank">QuinteMusic</a>/<a href="https://quintelive.ca" target="_blank">QuinteLive</a></strong> (2023, not yet launched) &mdash; Reviving a pre-COVID project to list and cover live music and musicians local to me (the Quinte, ON region).</li>

Featured events and crowdfunding , while we (the team) also discussed how we could underwrite our "amplify" mechanic with smart contracts, prior to ETH existing. Like Twitter + Reddit + Kickstarter for local music. Built a small team around the idea and was included in a <a href="https://betakit.com/new-mars-report-warns-that-it-may-be-time-for-canadian-media-companies-to-look-elsewhere/" target="_blank">MaRS report on Canadian media (2014)</a>.</li>

      <li><strong>EVM Secrets</strong> (2022) &mdash; Implemented secrets sharing both with and without replay protection. Inspired and borrowing ideas from ERC712, but not fully compliant.</li>
      <li><strong>SlimeBrawlyBrawl</strong> (2022) &mdash; Unity3D game inspired by Super Smash Bros made in a single player endless run style. Intend to launch, needs largely RC polish + store asset creation.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/proggR/dfm" target="_blank">DFM</a>/<a href="https://github.com/proggR/dfm-min" target="_blank">dfm-min</a></strong> (2022) &mdash; Imagining Diamond Facets as operating similar to packages in other contexts, DFM aimed to be like NPM for ERC2535, while dfm-min was a minimized downloadable that would provision your diamond dev environment from your DFM compliant config, aiming to be the simplest means to spin up a fresh ERC2535 targeted workspace.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/proggR/updraft-astro-tailwind" target="_blank">Astro/Tailwind (aka Updraft)</a></strong> (2022) &mdash; Simple/reusable components made with AstroJS. Leverages TailwindCSS.</li>

      <li><strong>OneBook</strong> (2022) &mdash;  Terraform monorepo pattern project aiming to facilitate the most common hosting and app stacks for hacking at greenfield side projects with less friction.</li>
      <li><strong>DEIT Accounts/Contacts</strong> (2022) &mdash; A full productivity suite made for crypto funds. Unreleased, but intended to launch separate accounting & contacts/newsletter verticals. Will be revisiting/revising as DEIT pivots toward active fund management. Python/Flask + React.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/proggR/bottlecap" target="_blank">Bottlecap/Deluge</a></strong> (2021) &mdash; After "reinventing money" with Fractional, I got thinking about capital flows, and aimed to develop a Bittorrent Peerwire Protocol inspired p2p capital flow framework called Deluge. Current form (Bottlecap) is a DEX crammed inside an ERC20 token resulting from a ~2 day hackathon. Bad code, potentially neat idea.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://fractional.foundation" target="_blank">Fractional Foundation</a></strong> (2021) &mdash; The project that would become the "capital model" of <strong><a href="https://wethecommonwealth.org" target="_blank">Commonwealth</a></strong>.

      <li><strong>Chainlink Hardhat Hackathon</strong> (2021) &mdash; Implemented Chainlink VRF, Price Aggregator and API integration contracts and corresponding Hardhat tasks/tests.</li>
      <li><strong>RoomSim</strong> (2018/19) &mdash; Unity3D project aiming to create a simple p2p virtual shared space, including p2p voice chat. Ie: the "Metaverse" before the Metaverse, but more useful.</li>
      <li><strong>Morpheus</strong> (2018) &mdash; Crypto price scraper & signals generator. Python used to ingest candle data and run each dataset through all available TA functions. Intent was to leverage ML to help discover new indicator combinations able to predict price movement shifts.</li>
